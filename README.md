## Who am I

An IT student and aspiring dev/sysadmin.

Daily linux user (and gamer, may the universe bless proton), I tend to spend a lot (too much ?) time automating any slightly repetitive tasks that I have to do.
To do so I use mostly shell scripts and Lua programs.

On the more developper side of thing I am mainly a Lua and Haskell user, however I dabble with C when I need that sweet speed. I can also write decent Python and Java.

I also tried a bunch of unusual/esoteric/obsolete langages including, but not limited to Prolog, Pascal, Elm, Forth, MoonScript, and Julia.

## My projects

Anything worth looking at is in the repoitories tab above this text

## Plans

- Learn more unusual/esoteric/obsolete languages
- Finaly work out how in the universe windows works
- Do more stupid projects
