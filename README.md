## Who am I

An IT student and aspiring dev/sysadmin.

Daily linux user (and gamer, may the universe bless proton), I tend to spend a lot (too much ?) time automating any slightly repetitive tasks that I have to do.
To do so I use mostly shell scripts and Lua programs.

On the more developper side of thing I am mainly a Lua and Haskell user, however I dabble with C when I need that sweet speed. I can also write decent Python and Java.

I also tried a bunch of unusual/esoteric/obsolete langages including, but not limited to Prolog, Pascal, Elm, Forth, MoonScript, and Julia.

## My projects

Anything worth looking at on github is pinned below this text, you can also have a look in the repositories tab.

I also have a [self hosted gitea instance](https://git.annwan.me/Annwan) with more projects there.

## Plans

- Learn more unusual/esoteric/obsolete languages
- Finaly work out how in the universe the Win32 API works
- Do more ~~stupid~~ ~~useless~~ random projects
